# Building a POST/PATCH/DELETE API

## Learning Goals

- Build an API to handle POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: a software application that
  allows two or more software applications to communicate with one another.
  Can be standalone or incorporated into a larger product.
- **HTTP Request Method**: assets of HTTP requests that tell the server which
  actions the client is attempting to perform on the located resource.
- **`GET`**: the most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the client is
  attempting to view the located resource.
- **`POST`**: the second most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the
  client is attempting to submit a form to create a new resource.
- **`PATCH`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is attempting
  to update a resource with new information.
- **`DELETE`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is
  attempting to delete a resource.

## Introduction

So far, we've seen how to set up an API with Flask to allow frontend
applications to access data from a database in a JSON format. For many
applications, just being able to access/read data isn't enough — what kind of
app would Twitter be if you couldn't write posts? What would Instagram be if you
couldn't like photos? How embarrassing would Facebook be if you couldn't go back
and delete those regrettable high school photos?

All of those applications, and most web apps, can be broadly labeled as CRUD
applications — they allow users to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and
**D**elete information.

We've seen a few ways to Read data in an API. We've also already seen how to
Create/Update/Delete records from a database using SQLAlchemy. All that's
left is to connect what we know from SQLAlchemy with some new techniques for
establishing routes and accessing data in our Flask application.

***

## Setup

We'll continue working on the game review application from the previous lessons.
To get set up, run:

```console
$ pipenv install; pipenv shell
$ cd server
$ flask db upgrade
$ python seed.py
```

You can view the models in the `server/models.py` module, and the migrations in the
`server/migrations/versions` directory. Here's what the relationships will look
like in our ERD:

![Game Reviews ERD](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/active-record-associations-many-to-many/games-reviews-users-erd.png)

`server/app.py` has also been configured with `GET` routes for all `Review` and
`User` records.

Now, run the server with Flask and re-explore some of the routes from our `GET`
lesson and the new `/reviews` and `/users` routes:

```console
$ python app.py
```

With that set up, let's start working on some CRUD!

***

## Handling DELETE Requests

Let's start with the simplest action: the DELETE request. Imagine we're building
a new feature in our frontend React application. Our users want some way to
delete their reviews, in case they change their minds. In React, our component
for handling this delete action might look something like this:

```js
// example code

function ReviewItem({ review, onDeleteReview }) {
  function handleDeleteClick() {
    fetch(`http://localhost:9292/reviews/${review.id}`, {
      method: "DELETE",
    })
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((deletedReview) => onDeleteReview(deletedReview));
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Score: {review.score}</p>
      <p>{review.comment}</p>
      <button onClick={handleDeleteClick}>Delete Review</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

So, it looks like our server needs to handle a few new things:

- Handle requests with the `DELETE` HTTP verb to `/reviews/<int:id>`.
- Find the review to delete using the ID.
- Delete the review from the database.
- Send a response with the deleted review as JSON to confirm that it was deleted
  successfully, so the frontend can show the successful deletion to the user.

Let's take things one step at a time. First, we'll need to handle requests by
adding a new route in the controller. We can write out a route for a DELETE
request just like we would for a GET request, just by changing the method:

```py
# server/app.py

# imports, config, games, game_by_id, reviews

@app.route('/reviews/<int:id>', methods=['GET', 'DELETE'])
def review_by_id(id):
    review = Review.query.filter(Review.id == id).first()

    if request.method == 'GET':
        review_dict = review.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            review_dict,
            200
        )

        return response

    elif request.method == 'DELETE':
        db.session.delete(review)
        db.session.commit()

        response_body = {
            "delete_successful": True,
            "message": "Review deleted."    
        }

        response = make_response(
            response_body,
            200
        )

        return response

```

Let's review the new content:

- The `@app.route` decorator accepts `methods` as a default argument. This is
  simply a list of accepted methods as strings. By default, this list only
  contains `'GET'`.
- The request context allows us to access the HTTP method used by the request
  and control flow from there. If the request's method is `GET`, we perform the
  same actions that we did in the `/games/<int:id>` route. If the method is
  `DELETE`, we delete the resource.
- Unsupported methods will receive a 405 response code by default. This means
  "Method Not Allowed".

Now, the question on everyone's minds: how do we actually send a `DELETE`
request?

### Sending Requests with HTTP Methods Other than `GET`

We all know from experience that we can delete resources on the internet:
emails, Instagram posts with unmade beds in the background, etc. There are many
different actions that can be carried out over the internet, and browsers are
actually very flexible on this front- it's HTML that isn't.

The W3C specifications for HTML say that it should only support `GET` and
`POST`. This means that any requests sent to the API through the browser with
unsupported methods will have these methods cast to `GET`...which will then be
used to update and delete resources. (We don't want that!)

Because of these limitations, we haven't explored too many HTTP methods with
Flask up to this point.

We can use Python scripts and applications with libraries like `requests` to
test our `DELETE` resource, but it is often easier to just use Postman.

> **NOTE: Requests to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` can only be sent using the
> Postman desktop client. This is unsupported in the cloud.**

Sending a `GET` request (the default method) for the first review will return
something similar to the following:

![GET request Postman for reviews/1 on localhost server with JSON response](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/building-post-patch-delete-api-postman-1.png
)

I know what you're thinking: how could we possibly delete this illuminating
review of "All lawyer as teacher world any"? How will anyone know that
"Republican help young large treatment note"?

Alas, we need to make sure our API works. Change the request method to `DELETE`
with the dropdown menu to the left of the search bar and submit a new request to
this resource.

![DELETE request Postman for reviews/1 on localhost server with JSON response](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/building-post-patch-delete-api-postman-2.png
)

> **NOTE: You may notice that the port accessed here has switched to
> 5001. You can run whichever port you like on your machine, as long as there
> isn't a conflict with another application. We typically use
> 5555 since it is the easiest 5000s port to remember after 5000, which sees the
> AirPlay conflict on MacOS.**

Navigate back to the same resource with `GET` and you should see a `500
Internal Server Error`. There's no resource here anymore! This is obviously not
the most helpful message, but it can be handled with control flow just like any
other error. A simple solution will be included in the solution code at the end
of this lesson.

***

## Handling POST Requests

For our next feature, let's give our users the ability to **Create** new reviews.
From the frontend, here's how our React component might look:

```js
// example code

function ReviewForm({ userId, gameId, onAddReview }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState("");
  const [score, setScore] = useState("0");

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    fetch("http://localhost:9292/reviews", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        comment: comment,
        score: score,
        user_id: userId,
        game_id: gameId,
      }),
    })
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((newReview) => onAddReview(newReview));
  }

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* controlled form code here*/}</form>;
}
```

This request is a bit trickier than the last: in order to create a review in the
database, we need some way of getting all the data that the user entered into
the form. From the code above, you can see that we'll have access to that data
in the **body** of the request, as a JSON-formatted string. So in terms of the
steps for our server, we need to:

- Handle requests with the `POST` HTTP verb to `/reviews`.
- Access the data in the body of the request.
- Use that data to create a new review in the database.
- Send a response with newly created review as JSON.

Let's start with the easy part. We can create a workflow for a new method like
so:

```py
#server/app.py

# imports, config, games, game_by_id

@app.route('/reviews', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def reviews():

    if request.method == 'GET':
        reviews = []
        for review in Review.query.all():
            review_dict = review.to_dict()
            reviews.append(review_dict)

        response = make_response(
            reviews,
            200
        )

        return response
    
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        response_body = {}
        response = make_response(
            response_body,
            201
        )
        
        return response

```

> **NOTE: A 201 status code means that a record has been successfully created.**

In this new block, we'll need to create a new record using the attributes
passed in the request.

```py
# server/app.py

# imports, config, games, game_by_id

@app.route('/reviews', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def reviews():

    if request.method == 'GET':
        reviews = []
        for review in Review.query.all():
            review_dict = review.to_dict()
            reviews.append(review_dict)

        response = make_response(
            reviews,
            200
        )

        return response
    
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        new_review = Review(
            score=request.form.get("score"),
            comment=request.form.get("comment"),
            game_id=request.form.get("game_id"),
            user_id=request.form.get("user_id"),
        )

        db.session.add(new_review)
        db.session.commit()
        
        review_dict = new_review.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            review_dict,
            201
        )

        return response

```

The request context has access to form data, among many other things. While we
haven't created a form here, makeshift forms can still be attached to requests
and their attributes can be parsed to create new records. It's important that
we create `review_dict` _after_ committing the review to the database, as this
populates it with an ID and data from its game and user. Submitting a `POST`
request with Postman should return something like this:

![POST request Postman for reviews on localhost server with JSON response](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/building-post-patch-delete-api-postman-3.png
)

Now that we've created, read, and deleted data, let's look at how to update.

***

## Handling PATCH Requests

Onto the last HTTP verb for this unit: `PATCH`! Now that you've learned about
`POST` and `DELETE` requests, this should be more straightforward. From the
frontend, we might need to use a `PATCH` request to handle a feature that would
allow a user to update their review, in case they change their minds:

```js
function EditReviewForm({ review, onUpdateReview }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState("");
  const [score, setScore] = useState("0");

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    fetch(`http://localhost:9292/reviews/${review.id}`, {
      method: "PATCH",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        comment: comment,
        score: score,
      }),
    })
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then((updatedReview) => onUpdateReview(updatedReview));
  }

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* controlled form code here*/}</form>;
}
```

The steps we'll need to handle on the server for this request are basically a
combination of DELETE and POST. We'll need to:

- Handle requests with the `PATCH` HTTP verb to `/reviews/<int:id>`.
- Find the review to update using the ID.
- Access the data in the body of the request.
- Use that data to update the review in the database.
- Send a response with updated review as JSON.

Give it a shot yourself before looking at the solution! You have all the tools
you need to get this request working. When you're ready, keep scrolling...

Ok, here's how the code for this route would look:

```py
# server/app.py

# imports, config, games, game_by_id, reviews
@app.route('/reviews/<int:id>', methods=['GET', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'])
    
    # GET
    
    elif request.method == 'PATCH':
        review = Review.query.filter(Review.id == id).first()

        for attr in request.form:
            setattr(review, attr, request.form.get(attr))

        db.session.add(review)
        db.session.commit()
        
        review_dict = review.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            review_dict,
            200
        )

        return response

    # DELETE
```

- First, we locate the record we want to change.
- Second, we update the record's attributes using `request.form`. We use
  `setattr()` here because it allows us to use variable values as attribute
  names- when we don't know which fields are being updated, this is important.
- From that point, this is very similar to our `POST` block from `'/reviews'`.
  We need to save the updated record to the database and then serve it to the
  client as JSON.

Run a `PATCH` request in Postman and you should see something similar to the
following:

![PATCH request Postman for reviews on localhost server with JSON response](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/building-post-patch-delete-api-postman-4.png
)

## Conclusion

You're at the point now where you can create a JSON API that handles all four
CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. With just these four actions,
you can build an API for almost any application you can think of!
